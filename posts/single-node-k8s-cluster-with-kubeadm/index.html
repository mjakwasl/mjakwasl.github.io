Today I’m gonna write about setting up a tiny (single node) Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm inside a clean, generic Linux system. You won’t find anything about k3s, k0s, Talos nor RKE2 here. It’s far from Kubernetes The Hard Way approach in terms of sheer knowledge however it still provides a fair amount of learning opportunity without a premade script / dedicated OS. So answering the “why?!” question - education is a number one priority here.\nPrerequisites It may surprise, but not a lot is actually needed to begin with Kubernetes. For such testing/learning purposes any spare hardware or a simple Virtual Machine will suffice.\nIn my case a new VM was created on the Proxmox VE server I run and the following resources were provided:\n4 CPU 6 GB of RAM 60 GB of Storage Network Interface with access to my local network and the internet Depending on available resources, the presented configuration can be scaled both ways however going extremally low will eventually cause issues. For the Linux distro, I decided to use Rocky Linux which is a fairly new, community driven RHEL-like distribution. I grew quite found of CentOS for years and was eager to finally try Rocky. Any Debian-based distro will also do the job but some commands will differ!\nPreparations Kernel configuration modules Proper kernel modules are required for k8s and containers to run.\nsudo dnf install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) sudo modprobe -a br_netfilter ip_vs ip_vs_rr ip_vs_wrr ip_vs_sh overlay To make the modules persist at reboots a configuration file has to be created.\n/etc/modules-load.d/kubernetes.conf\nbr_netfilter ip_vs ip_vs_rr ip_vs_wrr ip_vs_sh overlay sys.ctl Kubernetes needs following settings to process network traffic and packets forwarding within the cluster. Another configuration file is necessary.\n/etc/sysctl.d/kubernetes.conf\nnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1 net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1 Config has to be applied with the following command.\nsysctl --system Swap Kubernetes wasn’t designed to work with swap partition due to challenging resource management and interference with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee. Even though it has recently became officially supported I wont be dealing with any of that for now.\nsudo swapoff -a sudo sed -e '/swap/s/^/#/g' -i /etc/fstab Firewall To allow internal and external traffic, the firewall needs to allow communication through specific ports\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={6443/tcp,2379/tcp,2380/tcp,10250/tcp,10259/tcp,10257/tcp,4789/udp} Because the goal of this blogpost is a highly unpractical scenario (single machine for both control plane and a worker node), additional ports can be opened to expose services via NodePort. Note that normally it shouldn’t be done on an any ControlPlane, ever.\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={30000-32767/tcp,30000-32767/udp} What are those ports for? Lemme explain!\nPort Description 2379-2380 etcd server and client API 4789 VXLAN backend for flannel 6443 Kubernetes API server 10250 kubelet API 10257 kube-controller-manager 10259 kube-scheduler 30000-32767 NodePort Services After all that shenanigans, those changes have to be applied sudo firewall-cmd --reload Container runtime A container runtime is needed for containerized apps to be run inside Pods. Containerd is an industry-standard in that matter and a considered a default with k8s.\nContainerd installation First, Docker Community Edition repository has to be added to the package manager. After updating repository’s cache, containerd can be installed.\nsudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo sudo dnf makecache sudo dnf install containerd Containerd configuration Before proceeding, Containerd has to be configured to use Systemd Cgroup. As a starting point I’m going to use the default config file which is generated by running\nsudo sh -c \"containerd config default \u003e /etc/containerd/config.toml\"; In the newly created file, SystemdCgroup entry has to be changed from false to true under `[plugins.“io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri”.containerd.runtimes.runc.options] key.\n/etc/containerd/config.toml\n[...] [plugins.\"io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri\".containerd.runtimes.runc.options] BinaryName = \"\" CriuImagePath = \"\" CriuPath = \"\" CriuWorkPath = \"\" IoGid = 0 IoUid = 0 NoNewKeyring = false NoPivotRoot = false Root = \"\" ShimCgroup = \"\" SystemdCgroup = false # \u003c---- from false to true! [...] It can also be quickly achieved by running a sed command\nsudo sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/' /etc/containerd/config.toml Enabling containerd daemon With the config.toml saved the containerd deamon can be enabled to start on boot.\nsudo systemctl enable --now containerd.service After system reboot, containerd.service is verified to be up and running\nsudo systemctl status containerd.service The actual k8s part After all this tedious prep it’s finally time to do something with kube in its name. Three packages are required to setup, run and manage the cluster: kubelet,kubeadm and kubectl. It’s crucial for their versions to match and to be in full control when it comes to updates. I chose the newest version for the time, which is 1.33.\nKubernetes packages installation First, Kubernetes repository has to be added to the package manager.\n/etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo\n[kubernetes] name=Kubernetes baseurl=https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.33/rpm/ enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.33/rpm/repodata/repomd.xml.key exclude=kubelet kubeadm kubectl cri-tools kubernetes-cni The following commands are issued to begin package installation\nsudo dnf makecache sudo yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes When the installation was done I enabled the kubelet service which is an optional step according to the documentation. This service will keep restarting until the actual cluster is up and running.\nsudo systemctl enable --now kubelet.service Initializing Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm It is time, let there be cluster!\nsudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 --skip-token-print The --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 flag is necessary for the simplest networking plugin I’m going to use (for now). The --skip-token-print flag disables printing a token which is required for connecting additional nodes. I’ve put it there just to flex.\nRunning the above command will initiate a Control Node creation and shouldn’t be problematic UNLESS any of preparation steps were omitted (which should be clear in the debug output) OR if someone insisted on running the node inside a Proxmox LXC (don’t ask how I know).\nkubeconfig file In order to use kubectl from an user account, the configuration file has to be copied to that user’s home directory. It is encouraged because kubectl doesn’t like to be run as root and it may impose implications.\nsudo cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/admin.conf export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/admin.conf Verification is in order!\nkubectl get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION k8s-node-0 NotReady control-plane 42s v1.33.1 Such an output gives two important information. The cluster was successfully initialized and the node is NotNoding… I mean NotReady. Waiting a bit more won’t resolve that issue. Trust me. So why is that?\nNetworking plugin installation Initializing a cluster doesn’t equip it with any networking capabilities. For Pods to communicate with each other a Networking Plugin is required. There are many to choose from and even though cilium seems to be a current go-to, this time I went with flannel - just to keep things simple and write another blogpost about replacing it eventually.\nkubectl apply -f https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/latest/download/kube-flannel.yml Above command will apply a manifest file from flannel’s repository, deploying flannel agent on the cluster. It’s preconfigured to use 10.244.0.0/16 cidr subnet and VXLAN as a backend - which explains opening the additional port a specifying that subnet during kubeadm init. After a short while kubectl get nodes should show the node being finally Ready\nAnother command worth trying is kubectl get pods -A which will list all running Pods across available namespaces. They should all be running by now or at least getting there.\nFrom a Master to a Worker Enabling a Control Plane node to work for itself is absolutely trivial and requires only removing the taint called :NoSchedule. It’s achieved by running the following command\nkubectl taint nodes node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane- The - at the end is what actually clears the taint from given node without changing its role\nOptionally, a worker label may be applied however it has no scheduling purpose, only organizational\nkubectl label node node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=\"\" As a bonus for my future self - this is how to reapply the:NoSchedule taint, duh.\nkubectl taint nodes node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane=:NoSchedule Testing, testing, 1-2-3 What’s better for testing purposes than good old NGNIX. The following manifest file creates a testnamespace, spawns a deployment called nginx with 3 replicas and exposes them through a NodePort service - also called ngnix.\nnginx-test.yaml\n--- apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: test --- apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: nginx namespace: test labels: app: nginx spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: containers: - name: nginx image: nginx:latest ports: - containerPort: 80 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: nginx namespace: test spec: selector: app: nginx ports: - protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 80 type: NodePort Presented manifest can be applied by running:\nkubectl apply -f nginx-test.yaml To check if Pods were actually created and which port was assigned to the service\nkubectl get pods -n test NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE nginx-96b9d695-264zx 1/1 Running 0 15m nginx-96b9d695-5xcns 1/1 Running 0 15m nginx-96b9d695-6l8nx 1/1 Running 0 15m kubectl get svc -n test NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE nginx NodePort 10.104.29.57 80:30716/TCP 15m And finally, by accessing IP Address of the Node (not the CLUSTER-IP listed) with assigned port which in this case is 30716, the default nginx welcome message is displayed🎉 ","wordCount":"1489","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-06-06T23:17:09+02:00","dateModified":"2025-06-06T23:17:09+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"wasl"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mjakwasl.github.io/posts/single-node-k8s-cluster-with-kubeadm/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"MjakWasl","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mjakwasl.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mjakwasl.github.io/ accesskey=h title="MjakWasl (Alt + H)">MjakWasl</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
